Voodoo framework

Voodoo is a simple framework for command line installer implementation. Voodoo
started as a fork of packstack.installer [1], which has some good parts, but
unfortunatelly also lots of bad parts. You will find the good parts in Voodoo,
but the bad parts have been left in packstack.installer (hopefully) and
rewritten from scratch. Note that there is no plan to have Voodoo plugins and
packstack.installer plugins compatible.

Goal is to make this Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3+ compatible using python-future.
