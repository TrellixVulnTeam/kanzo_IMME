Kanzo framework

Kanzo is a simple framework for command line installer implementation. Kanzo
started as a fork of packstack.installer [1], which has some good parts, but
unfortunately also lots of bad parts. You will find the good parts in Kanzo,
but the bad parts have been left in packstack.installer (hopefully) and
rewritten from scratch. Note that there is no plan to have Kanzo plugins and
packstack.installer plugins compatible.
